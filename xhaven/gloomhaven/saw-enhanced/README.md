# "Saw" Enhanced

This directory contains **_fancy_** med packs that can be dealt directly to a player color
by pushing the button on the card.  It also has _recall_ buttons to get all your cards back
if they haven't been returned to you.

I need to make an official workshop posting for the object asset.  I made my own texture ([Small Medical Pack](http://cloud-3.steamusercontent.com/ugc/1704034601418160434/F0F4815ED90BDCEF3D655CA5984B4CED6E43C147/)) for the
box and used the [Rob Mayer TTS Library](https://github.com/RobMayer/TTSLibrary) to source the [box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobMayer/TTSLibrary/master/boxes/tuckbox-1.obj).
